#' A checker function to use with learnr
#'
#' For exercise checking, learnr tutorials require a function that learnr can
#' use in the background to run the code in each "-check" chunk and to format
#' the results into a format that learnr can display. The function must accept a
#' specific set of inputs and return a specific type of output. Users are not
#' intended to use the function themselves, but to pass it to the
#' \code{exercise.checker} knitr chunk option within the setup chunk of the
#' tutorial.
#'
#' Similar to grader's \code{grade_learnr()}, testwhat provides
#' \code{testwhat_learnr()} for this purpose. To enable exercise checking in
#' your learnr tutorial, set \code{tutorial_options(exercise.checker =
#' testwhat_learnr)} in the setup chunk of your tutorial.
#'
#' @param label Label for exercise chunk
#' @param solution_code R code submitted by the user
#' @param user_code 	Code provided within the "-solution" chunk for the
#'   exercise.
#' @param check_code 	Code provided within the "-check" chunk for the exercise.
#' @param envir_result 	The R environment after the execution of the chunk.
#' @param evaluate_result The return value from the \code{evaluate::evaluate}
#'   function.
#' @param ... Unused (include for compatibility with parameters to be added in
#'   the future)
#'
#' @return An R list which contains several fields indicating the result of the
#'   check.
#' @export
